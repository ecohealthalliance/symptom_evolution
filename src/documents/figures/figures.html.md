## Figure 1
### Conceptual diagram 
* Show the epidemic curve and trying to get ahead
* x = time
* y = # of cases

## Figure 2
### Multi plot
* x = time
* y = symptoms (horizontal bars) = no labels
* Lattice plot with ~12 candidate diseases
* Put the names in the appendix
* Allow user to click and expand a plot


## Figure 3
### Comparative plot
* x = time
* y = symptoms (horizontal bars) = labels
* Compare 2 (or more) contrasting outbreaks  
  e.g. H7N9 and MERS

## Figure 4 
### Generalized model
 * x = time
* y = # of symptoms (curve)
* Model built upon ProMED
* Contrain uncertain and improve predictive power
* generate a Bayesian prior by disease category
* Theoretical max # of symptoms
* Effort x discovery (~discovery curve)
* How many samples

## Figure 5
### Communities of symptoms
* x = time
* y = # of symptoms
* Have curves for social media, news media, and scientific literature
* show the social media pushing us ahead of the curve

## Figure OPT
### Mo' data
* x = time
* y = # of symptoms
* Can we shift the curve to the left by adding more data sources

## Figure OPT
### Golden Symptom
* hierarchical decision tree
* does it have symptom "b" Y/N then
* add numbers for when we can successfully diagnose each promed report
* is there other literature on this approach?
* can this be programmed?

## Figure OPT
### Signal to noise
