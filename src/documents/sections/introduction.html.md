## Introduction

Goal - Get ahead of the epidemic curve

### Candidate Hypotheses

* There is an asymptopte for symptom evolution
* There is an underlying 'rule' for determining certainty
* With more 'effort' (e.g. data sources, reports) evolution is faster
* Symptom evolution is faster in countries with high GDP
* Symptom evolution differs by disease 'family'
